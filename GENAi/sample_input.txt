Generative AI (GenAI) refers to algorithms capable of generating text, images, or other media in response to prompts.
These models, such as OpenAI's GPT or Google's BERT, are trained on massive datasets and fine-tuned for specific tasks.
GenAI can be applied in industries like healthcare, finance, and education to automate processes and improve efficiency.

In this document, we explore prompt engineering, summarization techniques, and keyword extraction strategies using LLMs.
